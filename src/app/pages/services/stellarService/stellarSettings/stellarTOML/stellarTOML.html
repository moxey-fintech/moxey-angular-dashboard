                Rehive generates a stellar.toml file based on your company assets and Rehive company details. It is best to double check the data that is generated before adding the file to your domain.
                Once checked the file should be uploaded to <span class="get-started-text">https://COMPANY_DOMAIN/.well-known/stellar.toml</span> that is controlled by your company.
