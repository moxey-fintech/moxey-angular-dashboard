        <p>Exchanges are triggered by Rehive webhooks. In order to correctly trigger a exchange you should ensure you have at least one webhook of the same
            event type as the exchange event. All exchange webhooks should be configured with the company secret
            because it ensures secure communication between Rehive and the extension.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">Note: The "secret" field will automatically get filled with the company secret by using the below webhook shortcut buttons
            or you can manually copy the company secret and paste it in the webhook forms ensuring secure
            communication between Rehive Platform and the extension.</p>
