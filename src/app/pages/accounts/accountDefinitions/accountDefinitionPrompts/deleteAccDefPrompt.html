<p>
    You are deleting the <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefObj.name}}</span> account definition. Deleting this account definition will also delete the accounts associated 
    with the <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefObj.name}}</span> account definition for all groups in this account definition. Any transactions associated with this account 
    definition will also be deleted.
</p>
<p class="custom-form">Deleting is <span class="required-icon">PERMANENT</span> and cannot be undone. You may create the account definition again at a later stage, but any associated deleted
    transactions will remain deleted, and the accounts generated will be new ones with different account references.
