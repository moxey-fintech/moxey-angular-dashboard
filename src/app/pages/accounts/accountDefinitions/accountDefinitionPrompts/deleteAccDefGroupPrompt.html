<p>
    You are deleting group <span class="get-started-text">{{groupObj.group.name}}</span> for the <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefName}}</span> account definition. Deleting this group will also delete 
    the accounts associated with <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefName}}</span> account definition for <span class="get-started-text">{{groupObj.group.name}}</span> group. Any transactions associated 
    with this account definition for <span class="get-started-text">{{groupObj.group.name}}</span> and the <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefName}}</span> account definition will also be deleted.
</p>
<p class="custom-form">
    Deleting is <span class="required-icon">PERMANENT</span> and cannot be undone. You may add the group again at a later stage, but any associated deleted
     transactions will remain deleted, and the accounts generated for this group will be new ones with different account references.
