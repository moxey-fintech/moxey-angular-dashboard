    You are deleting currency <span class="get-started-text">{{currencyObj.currency.display_code}}</span> for group <span class="get-started-text">{{groupName}}</span> in 
    the <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefName}}</span> account definition. Deleting this currency will also delete this currency 
    in any accounts associated with this account definition for <span class="get-started-text">{{groupName}}</span> 
    group. Any transactions associated with this currency for <span class="get-started-text">{{groupName}}</span> 
    and the <span class="get-started-text">{{accDefName}}</span> account definition will also be deleted.

<p>
    Deleting is <span class="required-icon">PERMANENT</span> and cannot be undone. You may add the currency again at a later stage, 
    but any associated deleted transactions will remain deleted.
